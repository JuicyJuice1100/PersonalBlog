# Summary

Ended up not not eating too much today.  Mainly because I ate a freaking whole container of cashews.  So decided to not eat the rest of the day.

I started out with a fruit smoothie.  Decided to add protein with it as well as I planned to boulder later in the day.

Was craving a pizza but was able to fight it off.  Just drank a lot of water instead.
