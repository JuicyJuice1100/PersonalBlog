# Summary

Decided to boulder today at the WP.

Did start a couple of warmups with some pinks and blues by the window.  Then went to  the overhang.

Attempted the black and blue, unfortunately was unable to top it.  Need to work on moving my body.  

I also did attempt the pink blue overhang as well.  That didn't go to well as I was already pumped like crazy after attempting the black and blue one multiple times.

Need to work on my my overhangs.

After doing some overhangs tried some of the blue slabs.  

Still have trouble with the blue volume slab, just not flexible enough to get my foot up.

Did do the other black blue slab no problem.  I knew I was pretty dang pumped when I tried the purple blue and couldn't do it.  I usually can do that one no problem.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Work on overhang
