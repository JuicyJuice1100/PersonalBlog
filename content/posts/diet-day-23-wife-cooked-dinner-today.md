# Summary

Ate a lot of left overs today.

Finished the avocado and black beans today.  So no more veggie tacos.  

Wife made a delicious gnocchi dinner today.  Will have left overs for tomorrow.  So yay! Don't have to cook.

All in all, a simple diet today.  Ate a little more than usual but overall I think it's still a good day for diet.
