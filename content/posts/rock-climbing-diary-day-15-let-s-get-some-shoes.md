# Summary

Went to MKE today to do some bouldering.

Ended up trying on a bunch of new shoes today.  Ended up getting the Scarpa Vapor V.  A good shoe with moderate downturn.  

My wife wanted to buy them as an early birthday gift, which was awesome.

Did the usual warmup with pinks and blues.

Flashed an orange blue on the small overhang.  Wasn't too bad.

Ended up finishing the yellow blue on the corner finally.  Once I got my feet up I was able to finish the problem easily.

I did try to finish the black green that goes around the stalactite.  I was so close, literally on had my hand on the last hold and slipped off.  I'll have to finish it next time.

Overall, good progress.
