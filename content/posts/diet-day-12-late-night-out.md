# Summary

Brother from out of town was visiting so ended up going out to eat with my family.  

Went out to eat at Movida for tapas.  Food was delicious, definitely recommend going there if you're in the Milwaukee, WI area.  

Did end up eating way less before dinner to prep for the night.

I also did end up doing a quick work out as well.

Overall, I think a good day considering going out to eat.
