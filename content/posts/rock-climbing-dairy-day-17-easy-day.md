# Summary

Went to WP today to do some bouldering.

I've been rock climbing a lot the past few days so today was just a easy day.  Didn't do anything too challenging just tried to climb a bunch of routes.

Mostly just climbed pinks and blues today.  I did attempt a few greens at the end of the session.  I topped the yellow green on the corner by the window.  Topped it first try which is awesome.

There are now 2 green problems that I'm going to start projecting out.

First one is the blue green on the corner by the slab.  That one is tricky as it starts with a heel hook, which I'm terrible at doing.  I think that one will take me a little bit.

Second one it the black green by the window.  This one I got pretty far into the route on my first couple attempts.  I think this one will be easier and I'll probably finish it on my next session.

Overall, I think today was a good day with just a lot of easy climbing and a couple of attempts on some greens.

I did forget to take a picture again...
