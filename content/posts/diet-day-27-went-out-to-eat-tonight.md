# Summary

Overall simple day.  Did end up going out to eat after rock climbing.

Still finishing left over BWWs.  Wife ended up having some as well for breakfast.  She regretted it immediately.  She does not do well with spice at all.  It was hilarious to watch.

We did end up getting a beer before going to dinner.

Didn't really eat anything else till dinner.  We went to Nessun Dorma in Riverwest.  Great place to get a bite and great drink deals.

Ended up splitting an appetizer, the artichoke dip.  I had the Puccini Panini which was great.  It also came with a large amount of salad which was awesome.  Helps with my portioning.

Did split a lemon cake with my wife afterwards.

I did forget to take a picture so here's a picture of Zazu again :P
