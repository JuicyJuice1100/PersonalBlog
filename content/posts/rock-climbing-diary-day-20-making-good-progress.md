# Summary

Went to WP today.

Did the usual warmup with pinks and blues.

There are a couple of new routes so I ended up trying out some new blues.  Killed a bunch of blues in the corner by the window and slab.  

Also flashed a blue around the corner by the workout room.  I was unable to do 2 of the blues, the yellow blue and the green blue by the yoga room.  

The yellow blue has a tricky move at the end with some slopers.  I think next time I go there I'll be able to finish that one.

The green blue has a trick start with a really bad hold.  I think that one will take a little bit to finish.

I attempted a blue green in the corner by the window.  A tricky slabby problem.  I think I'll be able to do it next time I go though.

Overall I think a good climbing day.  Making a lot of progress.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Keep projected greens
