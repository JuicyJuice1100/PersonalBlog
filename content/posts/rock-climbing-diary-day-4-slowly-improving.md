# Summary

Only did bouldering today at the WP site.

Did a lot of repeat problems today to make sure I have proper technique.  Found I need to make sure I use less arms for problems.

All the problems by the window got replaced, so lots of new problems.  

Warmed up with a few simple pink problems & a few simple blue problems.

Tried a lot of slab style problems today.  Finished the blue blue with the finger start holds.  Was able to do it with no issues.  

Did finish the new purple blue by the window as well.  Was unable to finish the new pink blue by the window.  Did attempt the blue slab with large volumes but was unable to top it.  Will have to try again next time.

Tried to do a few greens today.  Unable to complete any of them.  Tried the green pink next to the blue blue, tried the green green next it as well.  Did attempt the orange green slab as well.

Forgot to take a picture...  so posting a random pic.
