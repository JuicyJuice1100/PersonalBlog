# Summary

Decided to have a more filling breakfast today with Rice and Eggs.

Didn't eat lunch but ate the rest of the Chipotle Clementine Cashews.  Basically half a container.

Did workout today so I guess it's okay.

Ate a light pizza today.  Only half of it, the rest are leftovers.  Definitely took my time eating which helped me not eat a lot for dinner.

Overall I think today was a good day.
