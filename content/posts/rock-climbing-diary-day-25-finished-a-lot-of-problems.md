# Summary

Went to WP today.

Did a long warmup today.  Just did blues for a warmup for like 30min.

I finally completed the blue green with the heal hook.  I literally did first try.  

I also finished the pink blue overhang.  Which I also did first time.

I did attempt a orange green by the window.  I got about half way up.  I think next time I'll be able to finish it next time I go.

I also attempted to do the blue green in the corner by the window again.  I got a little bit further and made good progress.  I think I might try to finish it next time.

I also decided to start projecting the orange green overhang problem.  This is definitely going to be a fun project.  I think it will take a while to finish it.  It has an interesting start with the feet starting first.

Today overall was a great day for climbing.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Keep projecting greens
