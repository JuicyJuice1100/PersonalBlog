# Summary
Hooray much better day.  Did skip lunch cause of work stuff but ended up eating a little bit of a snack.

Made some simple fried rice w/ egg, veggies, and cut up hotdogs. (Didn't have chinese sausage available)

Trying to get rid off most of the food in the house so that we can start doing small grocery trips more often instead of buying a large amount of groceries at once.  Might do a mini blog about it in the near future.

# Breakfast:
Homemade granola w/ oatmilk

# Lunch
Nothing

# Dinner
Fried Rice
- Fried Rice w/ egg and a little salt & pepper
- random frozen veggies
- chopped up hot dogs (didn't have chinese sausages)

# Snack
- Cashews

# For Next Time
Gotta make sure I don't skip meals.  Gotta eat something small at least.
