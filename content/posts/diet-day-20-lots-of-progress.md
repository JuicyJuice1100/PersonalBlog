# Summary

Today was a simple day.

Was pretty hungry from rock climbing today so ate a little more than usual.  But over all I think it was relatively healthy.

Needed to get rid of some left overs so ended up using and eating a bunch of those.  I might need to start keeping track of calories so I can be a little more accurate with my diet.

Didn't take a pic so here's some food from my dinner at Mistral.

# Breakfast

Eggs and Rice

# Lunch

Left over mac & cheese with kidney beans and a little gochujang.

# Dinner

Veggie Tacos

* Avocado
* Black Beans
* Goat Cheese
* Feta
* Tomatoes
* Cilantro
* Sea Salt
* Hot Sauce
* Flour Tortilla

Left over vegan beer cheese and tortilla chips

# Dessert

Low Fat Vanilla Ice Cream w/ Dark Chocolate Shavings & pop tart bits

# For Next Time

* Start keeping track of my calories
* Keep portions small
* Keep doing this blog & keep up the good work :)
