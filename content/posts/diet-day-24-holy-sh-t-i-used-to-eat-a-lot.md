# Summary

Didn't eat too much today.  

Decided to get Buffalo Wild Wings today.  I got my usual for their BOGO deal which is 30 wings in total.  Holy sh*t, I can't believe I used to eat 15 of those wings in one sitting.  I only ate 6 today and felt full.  I did eat a bunch of veggies to help me not eat fast but damn did I eat a lot before dieting.

Today was an eye opener on how well I'm doing with my diet.
