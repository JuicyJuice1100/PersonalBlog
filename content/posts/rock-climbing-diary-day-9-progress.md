# Summary

Some more bouldering at WP.

Did some warmups on some simple blues and pinks.

Attempted to finish the black blue overhang today.  Got a lot further but couldn't finish it.  Will finish it next time cause it's probably going to get replaced soon.

Tried to finish the volume blue problem as well.  Made some good progress and got a lot further.  Will probably finish it next time.

Otherwise just did a few random problems here and there.  Was mostly concentrating on trying to finish those two.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Finish the black blue overhang & volume blue problem
