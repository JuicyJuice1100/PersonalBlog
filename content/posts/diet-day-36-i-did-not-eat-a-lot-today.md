# Summary

Today I did not eat a lot.  I ended up not really eating cause I didn't want to eat too much before rock climbing.  The issue was that I ended up getting light headed while rock climbing so I had to buy a protein bar to get something in my system.

Other than that it was just a pretty good day.

Forgot to take a picture again so here's an old pic.
