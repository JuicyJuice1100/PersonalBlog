# Summary

Had a busy day at work today so only ate a small breakfast of homemade granola and some oat milk.  Got a different brand of oat milk this time.  Less sugar and vanilla so really tastes like oats.

Did end up snacking on some mixed nuts through out the day and drinking lots of water.

For dinner had to stop by the store for some avocado and just ended up eating some leftover veggie tacos.  Did end up mixing a few more ingredients with the new avocado.

Finished the night with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Didn't take a pic so here's some food from my dinner at Mistral.
