# Summary

Today was a pretty normal day.

Wife made a great keto friendly salad for dinner today.  Tasted great, really refreshing.  

I did have to eat another half a protein bar before rock climbing today cause dinner was made a little late.  I didn't eat dinner till late in the evening after rock climbing.

Other than that it was a pretty normal day.
