# Summary

Went to MKE today to do some bouldering.

Did the usual warmup with pinks and blues.

Tried to figure out some greens today.

Still couldn't finish the blue green slabby problem.  Just cannot land the last move.

I mostly was trying to finish the black green problem that goes around the stalagmite.  Such an interesting problem.  I finally figured out how to do the hard part but damn does that put a lot on my hand and wrist.  Just have to push super hard on the stalagmite with my hand and trust my foot.  I think next time I go I'll be able to figure out that problem.

I did try on some new shoes today.  Definitely need to get some cause mine have holes in them.  Aggressive shoes are definitely different but I think I'll getting a pair of aggressive shoes cause I mostly to bouldering.

Other than that, I think today was decent.  Made a lot of progress on the problem I was  trying to figure out.

Forgot to take a picture again so here's another picture of Zazu.
