# Summary

Had a busy day at work today so only ate an apple for breakfast today.  Just needed something to jumpstart my day.

I was getting pretty hungry during lunch but didn't want to cook anything so ended up just eating some homemade granola w/ oat milk.

I tried to wait till after rock climbing to eat but I just got really hungry so ended up eating dinner before rock climbing.  Made chicken caprese w/ a balsamic glaze that I used as a dressing for the spinach leaves.  The potatoes were pretty simple w/ salt and pepper.  Over all a good and simple meal.

For dessert I ended up eating a tangerine for a little sweetness.  

After rock climbing I ate another tangerine just to get something in my system.  Probably could do a protein shake of some sort instead but just wasn't feeling it so just ended up eating a tangerine.

Almost forgot to take a picture so some of the food was eaten when I took the pic.
