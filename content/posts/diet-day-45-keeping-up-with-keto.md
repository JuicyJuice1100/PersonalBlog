# Summary

Today was just a normal keto day, nothing special.

I did cook chicken again for dinner.  Made a simple chicken salad.

Pan fried the chicken then cooked some celery in the chicken fat w/ some red wine vinegar and mirin.  Placed the chicken on top of the celery and finished it in the oven.

For the cooked salad, through butter onion and garlic with some salt and pepper in a pan to give a good cook.  Threw the tomato grapes in followed by cilantro.  Then threw kale and some spinach leaves.

Made a quick guacamole to go on top of the salad.  Sprinkled some cashews on top and finished it with the chicken.  

I couldn't let the celery go to waste so just ate that on the side.  Turned out pretty good.
