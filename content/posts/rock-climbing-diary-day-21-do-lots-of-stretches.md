# Summary

Went to WP today.

Did the usual warmup with pinks and blues.

Ended up keeping it pretty simple.  Only did a few new routes by the overhang section.  But other than that just did a lot of climbing today.

Flashed the blue blue route by the overhang.  Was pretty simple just had one difficult move that has a huge flag.  Other than that pretty simple.

I did attempt to do a pink blue route by the overhang.  Has a tricky move with some pinches.  I feel like it will take a while for me to figure that one out.

I attempted to do the blue pink slab problem by the corner.  It took me a while to be able to get my left foot to the higher foot hold but finally got it.   I did make some good progress but still have a lot to go with that problem.  I think it will take quite a while to figure that problem out.

Overall a good climbing day.

# Future Goals
