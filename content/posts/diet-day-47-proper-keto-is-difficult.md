# Summary

Day 2 of using the app to keep track of my carbs.

Keto diet is kind of difficult.  I want to eat more fruit and some veggies but I'm so limited to what fruit and veggies I can eat.  Along with how much I can eat.

Today's diet was mostly just greens and lots of meat.

My dinner was so simple cause I didn't have any carbs available for the day.  So basically just had to drink water for the rest of the day cause I didn't have anything available that had 0 carbs.

Might have to go shopping tomorrow for some meat for the week before out trip next weekend.

At least my caloric intake is low so I'll be losing weight from the low caloric intake as well.  I'm hoping my body goes into ketosis soon.  I don't want to be on this diet  for longer than a month.  So much salt and meat.
