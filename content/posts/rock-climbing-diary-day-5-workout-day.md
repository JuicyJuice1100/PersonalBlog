# Summary

Did a quick workout today.  

My buddy AJ made me a great workout regiment.  I didn't go too hard the day before at the rock climbing wall so felt that  I could do a workout.  Also going out to eat tonight so probably a good idea to work some of that off.

Because the food was sooo good from dinner, decided to use another picture of the food for the cover.

# Workout

2 Cycles, 30 seconds each, 30 seconds rest, 1.5 min rest between cycles

* Goblet Squat
* Suitcase Carry (L)
* Pushups
* Suitcase Carry (R)
* Supported KB Row (L)
* Supported KB Row (R)
* Crunch

Try to do as many reps in 30 seconds

# Future Goals

* Try to do more workouts along with my rock climbing
* Possibly make some workouts on the wall
