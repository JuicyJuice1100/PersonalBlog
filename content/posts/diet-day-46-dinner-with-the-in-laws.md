# Summary

Today I started to use an app to keep track of my calories and carbs.  The app I use right now is Carb Manager.  A good app that allows you to search foods and it automatically figures out the nutritional values based off the portion that you put in.

I found out that some of the stuff I eat is not keto friendly through the new app.  So I'll have to start taking some stuff out of my diet, such as the amount of fruit and the protein bar that I eat.

My in-laws treated the Wife and I to dinner today for a late birthday celebration to a nice restaurant called the Packing House.  I was very limited with what I could eat there but I was able to keep it keto friendly.  Had to give everything I couldn't eat to my wife.

I couldn't eat anything for dessert so just had some black coffee.  Did think about putting some Splenda for sweetener, but decided not to.  But I might buy some in the future to make some keto friendly desserts.

I did go above my carb count by 5g unfortunately.  But I think I can fix that by taking out the protein bars out of my diet.  My goal carb count is 23g daily.  So it's still pretty good, still under 30g.  I think overall I did pretty well today.
