# Summary

Today was similar to yesterday.

I did run out of oat milk so decided to make my own oat milk cause I have so many oats. Turned out okay but definitely way too much work to strain.  Probably just going to stick with buying it from the grocery.  Plus the flavor is definitely more oaty and less like a 'milk'.

The nice thing is that I got to reuse the oat milk container.
