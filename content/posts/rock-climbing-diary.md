# Summary

Only did bouldering today at the MKE site.  Honestly, I only do bouldering.  Need to expand out to top rope and sport climbing.  

Concentrated on doing some more overhang today.  Will probably feel it tomorrow.  

Did all the pinks (V0 - V1) in the end section.  Could not complete any blues (V1 - V2) today.  Need to concentrate on using less arms and using my feet and the rest of my body more.

Wife decided to come with today and got a hold of my phone so of course she decided to take some silly pics.  Which of course I will have to use for the cover photo.

# Future Goals

* Need to concentrate on using more feet and the rest of my body especially on over hang.
* Practice flagging and shifting body weight on easier problems
* Have to get belay certified so I can start doing some top rope
* Do more auto belay and top rope
* Take sport climbing class
