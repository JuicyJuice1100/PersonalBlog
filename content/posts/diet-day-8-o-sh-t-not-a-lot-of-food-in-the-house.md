# Summary

Decent day.  

Wife ate all the leftover ratatouille so had to figure out what to make for dinner after my climbing session.  

Ended up using some kidney beans and left over pasta, peppers, and Korean BBQ sauce.  Tasted pretty good for just mixing a bunch of left overs together.

# Breakfast

Homemade granola w/ oat milk

# Lunch

Nothing

# Snack

Mixed Nuts

* Cashew
* Macadamia

# Dinner

# For Next Time 

Stop skipping lunch.  Eat at least something even if it's small.

Do more meal prep.  Especially if wife eats a lot of the food that I planned on using/eating.
