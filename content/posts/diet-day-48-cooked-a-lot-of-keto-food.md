# Summary

Ended up cooking a lot of keto food today.  

Made some stuffed mushrooms, which I think might become a usual thing.  Tasted delicious.

I also tried making some keto fat bombs.  Probably not going to do that again.  Tastes awful.  I will have to finish the rest of them though... I'm not excited.

Otherwise I think today was a good keto day.  Kept below my net carb goal.
