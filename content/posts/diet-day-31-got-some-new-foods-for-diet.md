# Summary

Another Simple day.

Went grocery shopping yesterday and got a bunch of new foods for my diet.  

Started my day with some yogurt, a protein bar, and some fruit.

Made some salad and ate some leftover salsa verde chicken with a carrot.  Made enough salad to last me the rest of the week.

Ended up just making something simple with stuff I had in the kitchen and the veggies I bought yesterday.  Used ramen noodles for the starch from some instant ramen packs I had.  I figured I would not eat those while dieting so might as well use the noodles at least.

Might need to cut some food tomorrow and Sunday to prep for my cheat day on Saturday.    Going to the state fair so I'm expecting to just eat a bunch of food.

Overall, a good day.
