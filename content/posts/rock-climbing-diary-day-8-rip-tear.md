# Summary

Some more bouldering at WP.

Did some warmups on some simple blues and pinks.

It's a good thing I finished that volume blue problem cause it got replaced.  Still trying to finish the new one.

Trying to finish a blue blue slab but having so much trouble trusting my foot to stand.

Did attempt a new green green and pink green on the slab corner.  Was not able to finish them.  I think I should be able to do the pink green no problem next time.  The green green will take a little bit.

Did a new green blue on the slab side.  Wasn't too bad as long as you have good feet.

Overall I think I have improved quite a bit.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Might have to start climbing harder.  As I'm usually am not to sore after my climbing sessions
