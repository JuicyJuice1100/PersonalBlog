# Summary

Went to WP today.

Warmed up with a lot of blues and pinks back to back with no rest.  Did that for like 10 min as my warm up.

Finally finished the yellow blue in the back.  Did it first try today.  Those slopers were pretty bad, but I ended up just powering through it.

Flashed a couple new blues by the window.  I still need to finish the purple blue by the window still.  It think I'll be able to get it next time.  Just need to make sure to set up my feet before grabbing that last hold.

I'm still projecting the blue green in the corner back wall with the heel hook.  I was able to get past the heel hook move but my feet keep slipping when trying to do the last little bit of the problem.  Those holds after the heel hook are weird, they look like jugs but they are really tight.  They're more like deep crimps.

I ended my climbing session with some moon board and tension board.  

I had to use the moon board cause the tension board was being used at the time.  Those problems are way harder.  Not only is it a static 40 degrees but also the holds are way harder than the tension board.

As for the tension board, I only topped a few problems.  The other ones I was not able to send.  

Tension and moon board are really difficult but I think I'll keep trying to add it to my routine.  It's a good strength workout.

Ended with some simple stretching.  I started doing stretching before I leave to make sure I get that in and work on flexibility.

Forgot to take a pic again.  So posted a pic of the king  crab I had the other day.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Keep projecting greens
* Start adding tension board to some of my sessions
* Remember to take a picture
