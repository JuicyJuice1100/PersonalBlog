# Summary

Today was a cheat day at the state fair.  Ate a bunch of carbs.

I tried a bunch of foods including a bug cupcake.  I did eat a lot of fried food so lots of carbs.  Good thing it was the start of my day so that included my breakfast and lunch.  The portions they serve at the state fair were huge so half the time I didn't end up finishing the whole thing even though I shared with the Wife.

For dinner I switched back to a keto meal and ate left over pork chops with lots of veggies.  Turned out pretty good.

Overall I think today was a pretty good cheat day.  I didn't eat as much food as expected which is good.
