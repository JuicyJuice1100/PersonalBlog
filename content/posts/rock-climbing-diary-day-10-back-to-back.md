# Summary

Did some bouldering at the MKE gym today.

The usual warmup with pinks and blues.

Tried to finish the blue green problem but just have an issue with reaching that last hold.  It's so far away and I'm literally standing on  my tip toes on a huge volume hold.  I basically just have to dyno for it.

I attempted to do the blue blue problem on the stalagmite.  Just need to get my feet up and really just push for it.  Once I get past the overhang of the stalagmite and get my feet up I think I should be good.

Did attempt to do other random problems but really only concentrated on those two.

I did meet some new peoples while climbing: Stephen, Michael, & Rachael.  Was doing a lot of the same problems with Stephen.

Will be rock climbing again tomorrow so this will be 3 days in a row for rock climbing.  So I'll have to make sure to rest well after tomorrow.

I keep forgetting to take a picture for the blog...

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Remember to take a picture for the blog
* If I end up back at MKE finish the problems above if they're still there
