# Summary

Only did bouldering today at the WP site.  

Did a lot of repeat problems today to make sure I have proper technique.  Found I need to make sure I use less arms for problems.  

Warmed up with some pinks (V0 - V1) and some simple blues (V1 - V2).  Still have a lot of trouble getting the start of the orange blue (orange holds, blue tape) by the windows.  That problems has a tough start.

Did finish the blue pink on the far side of the wall that was giving me trouble.

Did do the black blue slab on the wall by the moon boards.

Attempted the orange green (V2 - V3) slab as well.  Got the start but couldn't finish it.  Man does that route have a scary foot drop.  

For fun did attempt the black white (V3 - V4) by the windows.  Just wanted to attempt the first move  cause it's so much fun. 

# Future Goals
