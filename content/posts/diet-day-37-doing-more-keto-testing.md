# Summary

Today was interesting.

Ended up going into the office for work.  Mainly cause I haven't seen anyone in a while.  My boss ended up order lunch for us from Chipotle.  Had one of their keto friend meals which was actually pretty good.

I did end up doing another keto meal for dinner as well.  Which I think ended up pretty good.

All together a pretty straight forward day.
