# Summary

Went to WP today to do some bouldering.

Ended up going out to eat with the wife for brunch.  All the places had long wait times so ended up climbing while we waited.  Then went back to climb again.

Goal today was just to climb a lot.  I didn't want to try anything too difficult.  So only climbed pinks and blues.  

Did end up flashing a few new blues including the new blue overhang.

I did end up ripping a little part of my skin on the upper part of my palm.  Kinda sucks cause in order to cover it I have to basically wrap my whole palm.

Overall I think it's nice to have days like this where I just climb simple problems but climb a lot.

I did remember to take a pic before a left.  Though the route I took a pic of was a route I didn't work on today :P

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Pick a green to solve
* Might need to add a little more working out to help improve
