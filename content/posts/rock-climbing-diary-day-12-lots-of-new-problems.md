# Summary

Went to WP today to do some bouldering.

Just did a lot of climbing.  Didn't really aim to finish anything today.  

I did climb the green blue on the slab wall first try today.

I also attempted a yellow green and and pink blue by the window.  Wasn't able to top any of them unfortunately.  

Otherwise just a lot of climbing today.  Did about 3 hours of climbing today.

I did forget to take a pic today so have to reuse.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Remember to take a picture
* Need to start trying to climb more greens
