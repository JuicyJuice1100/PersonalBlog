# Summary

Crazy busy day today.

Ended up eating a breakfast to get me through the day.  And a quick granola bar before rock climbing.

Ended up going out tonight to a pretty dope brewery.

For some reason was craving something sweet later at night so ended up drinking my wife's left over soda and some apple juice.
