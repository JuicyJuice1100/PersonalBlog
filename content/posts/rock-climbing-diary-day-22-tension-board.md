# Summary

Went to WP today.

Did the usual warmups today.  

They put up a new volume problem.  It was lots of fun.  Had two big moves.  I was able to top it on my third try which is good.

After that decided to try the tension board for the first time.  Definitely different than what I expected.  Those holds definitely rubs off my skin on my fingers.  I was able to finish a few problems.

I think I'll start putting more tension board stuff into my routine.

Forgot to take a picture so had to use an old picture. 

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Keep projecting greens
* Remember to take a picture
