# Summary

Woke up pretty late today so ended up having a brunch smoothie.

First time making these smoothies.  Definitely need to get the ratio right between oat milk and fruit cause I put way too much fruit.

Because the Wife and I planned to go out today tried not to eat too much before dinner.  Dinner was huge, no way could I finish that in one siting so will probably end up eating the rest for lunch tomorrow.

Have to not go out to eat till next weekend.  Hopefully I can keep that goal.

# For Next Time

Today was a cheat day so need to not go out to eat till next weekend.  Will also have to keep in mind leftovers.  Try not to get too much food next time so I don't have too many leftovers the next day.

I did skip lunch today which I think is okay considering the amount of food I ate for dinner.  But should not make this a normal thing.
