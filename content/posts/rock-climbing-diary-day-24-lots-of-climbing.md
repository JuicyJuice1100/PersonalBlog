# Summary

Went to WP today.

Warmed up with a lot of blues and pinks back to back with no rest.  Did that for like 10 min as my warm up.

There where a few new routes over by the overhang.  Got to do a few of them.

Did a pink blue one with a large volume at the top.  Was able to do it in 2 attempts.  I should've flashed it but I just missed the top by like a centimeter.  

I did try to do a blue blue problem.  It has a pretty big move in the middle.  I only attempted once so I think next time I should be able to top it.

I attempted the green green as well.  Very crimpy problem, really hard to get the start and still is difficult after that.

I attempted the blue green in the corner by the window again.  I still am stuck on the middle section where my body is outstretched.  I really don't know what to do there.

I gave one attempt of the blue green in the far corner.  It's the one in the picture.  Still have trouble with the crimp holds.

Overall I think a good day.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Keep projecting greens
