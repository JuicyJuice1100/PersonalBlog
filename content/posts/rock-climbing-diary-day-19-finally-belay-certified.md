# Summary

Went to MKE today.

Finally got belay certified.  It was a pretty easy test.  My friend wanted to practice some more so he couldn't take the test today.  I did end up doing a few top rope routes so that my buddy could practice some more.

Climbed mostly just simple routes: 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9.  I did try a 5.11 but unfortunately was not able to complete it.  It was a little tricky but I think if I tried it again I would be able to complete it.

After some top rope we ended up doing some bouldering.  I didn't really warm up on bouldering cause I warmed up with top rope.

Ended climbing both new blues on the new section of the wall.  I did also completed the black green on the new section.  I did cheese the beginning so it was way easier than expected.  The final hold was a little weird but I was able to top on the 2nd attempt.

I also attempted the yellow green as well.  I was not able to complete that one though.  The beginning was extremely difficult cause of the starting footholds.  They flipped the footholds upside down to make them really slippery.  Honestly hate that start.

I think today was a really productive day in rock climbing.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Keep projected greens
