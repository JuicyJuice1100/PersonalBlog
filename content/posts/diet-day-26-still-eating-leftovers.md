# Summary

Trying to finish all the left overs without eating too much at once.  Got through all the Mango Habenero chicken at least.

Ended up going to my parents condo for dinner.  Ate Filipino food.  Still kept the portions small, even though my mom tries to get me to eat more.  

Other than that, pretty normal diet day.
