# Summary

Went to MKE today.

Decided to take the belay class finally with my buddy.  Was a good refresher.  Will take the belay test next time we go to MKE.

I did do some bouldering before the belay class.  

Again, warmed up with some pinks and blues.  They did have some new problems on the slabby part of the wall.  I flashed a pink blue one that went around the volumes.

I didn't go too hard today so only attempted a few green problems.  

I tried the black green that goes around the stalactite.  Got to the finally hold but just couldn't get my body set to get my 2nd hand on the hold.  I'll have to finish it next time I go.

I did attempt the black green overhang as well.  That one has a tricky start so I'll have to sit down and figure it out sometime.  

I forgot to take a picture again so here's a picture of Zazu again.
