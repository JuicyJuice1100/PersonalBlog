# Summary

Went to WP today to do some bouldering.

Still breaking in my new shoes.  I think it will take a few days of climbing for them to fully break in.

Did the usual warmup with pinks and blues.

Found out they changed all the routes for the big overhang section.  So I wasn't able to finish the black blue one they had there.  There are a lot of new overhang problems that I'm excited to try out next time I go bouldering.  They were actively working on route setting so I didn't get a chance to try any of the over hang problems.

They also replaced a bunch of the slab problems.  I got to try a bunch of those.

I flashed a yellow blue by the slab wall and a pink blue next to the overhang section.  I tried to top the orange blue problem next to the overhang but still have a lot of trouble.  Only did a few attempts so I wouldn't get fixated on that problem.

I tried to top the another orange blue by the slab wall but I was unable to top it.  I think I'll get it next time if I just bring my feet up.

I attempted a few green problems as well.  All of them were difficult.  A lot of them I had to do a heal hook, which I'm pretty bad at.  It'll be good practice for me.  I'll have to choose one of the green problems to sit down and solve.

All in all I think I had good progress today.  

# Future Goals

* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Remember to take a picture
* Pick a green to solve
* Might need to add a little more working out to help improve
