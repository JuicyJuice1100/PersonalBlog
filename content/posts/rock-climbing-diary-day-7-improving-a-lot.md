# Summary

Decided to boulder today at the WP.

Did some warmups on some simple blues and pinks.

Finally did the blue volume slab problem.  Once I got my leg up there it was much easier.

Also flashed a new green blue on the far wall.  Was fun problem that required a lot of rotating feet and trusting feet.

Climbed the green green problem in the corner slab wall.  Wasn't too bad just had to trust feet.  I would have gotten it first try but foot slipped on the last hold.

Still trying the orange green slab problem.  Can do the beginning but can't do the crux with all the crimps.  

Trying to figure out the pink blue slab problem by the blue volume problem.  Is a tricky one that might take a little bit.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Might have to start climbing harder.  As I'm usually am not to sore after my climbing sessions
