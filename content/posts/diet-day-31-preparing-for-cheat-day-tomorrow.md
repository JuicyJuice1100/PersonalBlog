# Summary

Preparing to eat a bunch of food tomorrow for the state fair.  So today I didn't eat too much.

Mostly just stuck with fruit, veggies, yogurt, and protein bars.

I made it through without craving too much food which is good.  I was starving after rock climbing though.  But luckily I saved the 2nd protein bar from the pack for later.

If this goes well and I still continue to lose weight after my cheat day I might change my diet to consume less calories to prep for a weekly cheat day.

# Breakfast

* Chocolate Protein Bar (Saved the other half for later)
* Yogurt
* Clementine

# Lunch

Nothing

# Dinner

* Other half of protein bar
* Yogurt
* Carrot

# Snack

* Apple

# For Next Time

* Start keeping track of my calories
* Keep doing this blog & keep up the good work :)
* Cut some calories out Friday and Sunday to prep for cheat day on Saturday
* See if I can afford to eat less food through the week and have a weekly cheat day
