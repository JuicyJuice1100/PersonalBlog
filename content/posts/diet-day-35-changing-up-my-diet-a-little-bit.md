# Summary

Today I wanted to try a keto diet meal.

I don't like the idea of keto but I think I could do a little variation of it.  I think what I'll do is eat a keto meal for breakfast and lunch.  Dinner I'll stick with what I'm doing by portioning.  

Wife made a simple salmon meal w/ some corn and rice.  I added a salad for more veggies.

Overall a good day.

Forgot to take a picture again so using an old pic.
