# Summary

Didn't skip a meal this time.  Hooray!!

Ended up cooking dinner w/ the Wife.  We made way too much food.  Ended up freezing a bunch of the chicken bites that were left naked.  Put the leftovers in a bunch of Tupperware  as premade meals.  Looks like I'll be having potato bowls for a few days.

Did have to go to the grocery store.  Ended up buying a bunch of nuts for snacks.

* Eat slower, so I don't eat as much
