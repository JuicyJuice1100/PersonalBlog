# Summary

Again, only did bouldering today at the MKE site.  Had some new people join in the climbing today.

Did way less overhang today.  Only did like 1 or 2 overhang problems.

Did all the pinks (V0 - V1) in the end section on the right.  Completed a few blues today (V1 - V2).  Did try to do a green (V2 - V3) that was a little more slabby with little overhang.  Couldn't complete it cause of the last hold.  Wish I was taller, need to figure out a way to reach that final hold.

Again, need to concentrate on using less arms and using my feet and the rest of my body more.

Forgot to take a pic for the blog... so here's picture of birb.

# Future Goals

* Need to concentrate on using more feet and the rest of my body especially on over hang.
* Practice flagging and shifting body weight on easier problems
* Have to get belay certified so I can start doing some top rope
* Do more auto belay and top rope
* Take sport climbing class
* Remember to take a picture for the blog
