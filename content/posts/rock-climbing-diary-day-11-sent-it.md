# Summary

I finally finished the volume blue problem.  Such a scary problem.  That ending took me a few tries. 

First try, I literally got to the top and my hand slipped and I fell.  Second try, I got to the top but didn't distribute my weight on my feet correctly so had to grab top of the wall.  Did figure out how to do it while I was up there so just had to send it.  Third try, finally sent it.  Took a few tries but finally did it.

I did try a few problems before that but really I mostly spent the day finishing this problem.

I remembered to take a pic but it is a shitty pic mainly cause I was too lazy to back up and get the whole problem in there.  So it's slightly slanted.

# Future Goals

* Keep cutting weight
* Start doing training for climbing, I want to improve my climbing  Need to create a training/workout plan
* Take a better pic
* If I end up back at MKE finish the problems above if they're still there
* Need to finish the black blue overhang before it gets replaced
