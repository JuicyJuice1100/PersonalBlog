# Summary

Went to WP today to do some bouldering.

Finished a lot of the blues that I was not able to finish before.  

Finally finished the blue blue slab.  Took a few tries but finally stuck the little jump.

Topped the yellow blue sloppy slab problem first try.  Just really good climbing.

Topped the orange blue problem around the corner first try as well.

I did attempt to greens today.  The orange green around the corner with a lot of big pinches.  I think this one will take a little bit to finish.

The pink green slab I also tried to top.  Just had trouble keeping my feet on the wall.  I think next time I can get especially if I try it when I'm fresh.

Attempted to finish the black blue over hang at the end of the session.  Got close but still have trouble at the end.

Overall great day to finish a lot of problems.
