# Summary

Today was a cheat day.  We ended up not going to the state fair today because of the rain.

I did intake a lot of food today.  I don't think I'm going to do a cheat day like this again.  It was a good test and I've learned I do not like eating this much food anymore.  Makes me feel awful.  

I will probably just stick with just doing cheat meals/snacks instead of prepping for a whole cheat day.
