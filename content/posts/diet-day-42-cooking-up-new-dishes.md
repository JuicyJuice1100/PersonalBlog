# Summary

Today was a pretty normal day.

I did end up cooking a keto friendly meal from scratch which is always a plus.  No recipe just decided to make something with ingredients that I had in the house.  The chicken breast was huge so I only ate like a 1/4 of the chicken.

Other than that, pretty normal day.
