# Summary

Another Simple day.

Finally finished all the left over buffalo wild wings.  Now need to finish all the other leftovers in the fridge.

Ended up just cooking a simple meal for dinner, which I think turned out pretty well.  No recipe, just trying to finish leftovers.  

All in all, I think today was pretty good.

Almost forgot to take a picture for the blog which is why the plating looks like sh*t.
