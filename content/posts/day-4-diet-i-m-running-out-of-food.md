# Summary

Still going strong.  

Wife ended up making a dinner dish w/ left over ingredients which ended up tasting delicious.  

It was also the first diet entry where I also went rock climbing.  I get famished after working out which makes it hard to not eat large amounts or order something to eat.  

I think I did okay as I mostly just snacked on nuts.  But man I was definitely craving a burger after climbing.

# Breakfast

Nature Valley Granola

# Lunch

Left over fried rice

* Rice
* Egg
* Hotdog
* Random Veggies
* Chinese Crackers

# Snack

Home Made Granola

* No Oat Milk  :(

(I desperately need to go grocery shopping)

Mixed Nuts

* Cashews
* Macadamias
* Almonds

# Dinner

Fish Pasta

* Baked Tilapia
* Egg Noodles
* Tomato Sauce w/ Capers

# For Next Time

I think planning snacks and courses will help a lot to prevent me from getting unhealthy foods that I crave. 

Need to plan foods around my climbing sessions to make sure I eat stuff that are filling but healthy.  Climbing definitely makes me crave unhealthy foods.
