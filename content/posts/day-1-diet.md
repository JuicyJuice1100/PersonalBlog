# Summary 
Whelp... I'm off to a great start.  Wife decided to get McDonalds for lunch so ended up getting some Mc'Ds.  

Plus I ended up eating the rest of her food to prevent leftovers.  The regret is real.

Otherwise I think the rest of the food I ate for the day was fine.

# Breakfast
Protein Shake
- 200ml oatmilk
- 1 scoop rice protein powder
- 1 scoop pea protein powder

# Lunch
McDonalds :(
- Chicken Sandwich
- 5 Chicken Nuggets
- 1 Medium Fry
- 1 Medium Coke
- Homemade Korean BBQ Sauce

# Dinner
Fish, Rice, & Veggies
- 1 Cup Rice
- 1 Cup Peas
- Talapia w/ light seasoning

# For Next Time
I gotta learn to say no to fast food... looks like I'll have to work off the Mc'Ds next time I go rock climbing.
