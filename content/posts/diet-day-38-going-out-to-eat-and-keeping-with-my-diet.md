# Summary

Didn't really eat too much until dinner today.

Kept with my typical breakfast with yogurt, half a protein bar, and clementine.  I am running out of food for breakfast so will have to go grocery shopping soon.

I didn't really eat too much for lunch.  Just had the other half of my protein bar to get something in my system before rock climbing.

Right after rock climbing went to dinner with my wife.  Went to Centro, which is always a treat.  

I did eat a little more carbs than I wanted to but I kept my portion pretty small.

After dinner I did bump into a homeless guy who seemed pretty nice.  I don't like giving money to hagglers, but because I had some left over food I ended up giving my left over food to help him out.  

Overall, pretty good day.
