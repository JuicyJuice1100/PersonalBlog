# Summary

Just ate a lot of left overs today.

I think it will take me a while to finish all these Buffalo Wild Wings.  Jeez I should get a smaller size next time.  I'm trying not to eat too much so I added rice and eating lots of veggies with it as well.

I'll probably be eating this for a while.
