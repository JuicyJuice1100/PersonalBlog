# Summary

Today was a cheat day.

Didn't eat too much in the early day as I was expecting to eat a lot tonight.

Checked out a Mediterranean restaurant called Mistral, was delicious.  I definitely recommend.  The wife and I pretty much just shared all out food.

All in all I think today wasn't too bad of a cheat day.
