# Summary

Today went out to my bosses house for a grill out.

Day started pretty normal with the typical breakfast of yogurt and half a protein bar.

Didn't eat till later in the day when I got to my boss's house for a work outing.  He grilled a lot of meat and had a lot of veggies and fruit.  So I mostly just ate veggies, some fruit, and lots of meat.  

After that meal I didn't eat anything for the rest of the day.  I pretty much ate enough especially cause tomorrow is my cheat day.

Getting used to the keto diet but it definitely weird to eat meat without any type of starch.  First time eating burger patty, hot dog, and brat without any bun.
